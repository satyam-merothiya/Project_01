                        <p> Everything you have ever seen on the web is considered 'front end'.Front end is what we see when we open a web page or app.
                            Code is downloaded from a server and is rendered to the screen by a web broswer.What happens when we interact
                            with the code is also considered front end.This is often referred to as the 'Presentation Layer' or 'Client' in software
                            development terms.
